## About 

'Save the Forest' was created for the Koding 48 hour hackathon. We have chosen to make an interactive data visualization piece. It is predicted that in 100 years there will be no rain forests left in the world (source: http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/various-deforestation-facts.php). The data starts at 1990, since that is the earliest available data, scaled compared to 2012 data.


We hope to inspire others towards progress in solving the issue of deforestation together, and share the knowledge!
